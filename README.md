# PowerBI-Dashboard-Cognifyz
As part of my Data Analytics internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I completed an end-to-end Power BI project consisting of 7 structured tasks, covering data exploration, gender analysis, correlation analysis, behavioral insights, source evaluation, and final dashboard design.
Throughout these tasks, I transformed raw data into meaningful insights and built interactive visual dashboards for clear decision-making.

🔷 Task Highlights:

🔹 Task 1 – Data Exploration & Summary Statistics
Imported, cleaned, and explored the dataset. Analyzed key metrics, distributions, and investment preferences.

🔹 Task 2 – Gender-Based Analysis
Compared investment choices across genders using bar charts and segmentation insights.

🔹 Task 3 – Savings Objective vs Investment Choice
Analyzed how different savings objectives influence investment preferences. Created comparative visualizations for correlation insights.

🔹 Task 4 – Investment Duration & Monitoring Frequency
Visualized duration patterns and examined how frequently investors monitor their portfolios.

🔹 Task 5 – Reasons for Investments
Identified the most common reasons for choosing investment avenues using categorical analysis and trend visuals.

🔹 Task 6 – Sources of Investment Information
Studied where individuals obtain financial information (e.g., newspapers, internet, consultants) and which sources they rely on most.

🔹 Task 7 – Final Dashboard Integration
Designed a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard incorporating all insights from previous tasks, enabling unified data storytelling.
